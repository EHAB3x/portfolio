# Angular Portfolio

This project is a modern, responsive portfolio web application built with Angular. It showcases personal information, skills, projects, and contact functionality, with a focus on clean design, accessibility, and maintainability. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling (with dark/light theme support), SCSS for custom styles, and a .NET backend API for dynamic data.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark/Light Theme Switch:** Toggle between dark and light modes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic Data:** Skills, projects, and other sections are fetched from a secure .NET API.
- **Contact Form:** Users can send messages via a validated form (with EmailJS integration).
- **Sectioned Layout:** Includes hero, about, skills, services, qualifications, projects, and contact sections.
- **SCSS Architecture:** Organized SCSS with variables, mixins, and responsive breakpoints.
- **ng-icons Integration:** Uses ng-icons for scalable, customizable icons.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of API timeouts and errors with user feedback.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML and ARIA-friendly components.
